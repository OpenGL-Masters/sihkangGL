# Learning openGL

---

## [W01] cmake_project_example
- I learned how to set up OpenGL on an M1 MacBook.
- CMake will be used for configuring and building projects.
- I will create a `CMakeLists.txt` file and configure and build the project using the command palette in VSCode.
- OpenGL will be compiled with Xcode (Apple supports OpenGL up to version 4.1).
